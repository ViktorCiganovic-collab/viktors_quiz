# React Quiz App

## Project Overview

This is an interactive **Quiz App** built using **React.js**. The app allows users to take a quiz with multiple-choice questions, track their score, and view their progress as they answer questions. Once all the questions have been answered, the app shows a congratulatory message with the user's final score and gives the option to restart the quiz.
